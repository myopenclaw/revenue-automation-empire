Welcome to Junior Science Lab! Today we're going to make a volcano erupt!

You'll need:
• Baking soda
• Vinegar
• Red food coloring
• A small container

First, put baking soda in the container. Add red food coloring to make it look like lava. Now pour in vinegar and watch the volcano erupt!

The science: Baking soda and vinegar create carbon dioxide gas. That's what makes the bubbles!
