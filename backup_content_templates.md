3. **Text-Only Video** (Animated text with music)
4. **Podcast Style** (Audio only with static image)
5. **Live Stream** (Unedited, authentic content)

### When Internet is Slow:
1. **Pre-recorded Content** (Upload from phone)
2. **Scheduled Posts** (Use buffer when connection is good)
3. **Mobile-First Content** (Create on phone, upload later)
4. **Low-Bandwidth Formats** (Images instead of video)

## 🔧 QUICK FIXES FOR COMMON ISSUES

### Video Won't Upload:
1. Check file format (MP4 recommended)
2. Reduce file size (compress with Handbrake)
3. Try different browser
4. Upload during off-peak hours
5. Use YouTube Studio app on phone

### Low Engagement:
1. Ask questions in captions
2. Respond to every comment
3. Use more hashtags (10-15)
4. Post at optimal times (check analytics)
5. Collaborate with similar creators

### Slow Growth:
1. Consistency is key (post daily)
2. Study competitors' successful content
3. Use trending sounds/topics
4. Cross-promote on all platforms
5. Run giveaways/contests

### Technical Issues:
1. **n8n down:** Restart with `n8n start`
2. **Dashboard down:** Restart with `node simple_analytics_dashboard.js`
3. **Piper TTS not working:** Check model file exists
4. **FFmpeg errors:** Reinstall with `brew reinstall ffmpeg`
5. **Ollama not responding:** Restart service

## 🎯 QUICK START COMMANDS

### Start All Services:
```bash
# Terminal 1: n8n automation
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace && n8n start

# Terminal 2: Analytics dashboard  
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace && node simple_analytics_dashboard.js

# Terminal 3: Content generation (when needed)
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace && node quick_content_batch.js
```

### Check Service Status:
```bash
# Check n8n
curl http://localhost:5678/health

# Check dashboard
curl http://localhost:3001/api/metrics

# Check AI tools
ollama --version
ffmpeg -version
which piper
```

### Backup Data:
```bash
# Backup analytics data
cp ~/.openclaw/workspace/analytics_data.json ~/backup/
